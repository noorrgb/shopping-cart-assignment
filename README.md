# Simple-shopping-cart

This sample project is simulating a universal shopping cart, created for DevCrew's Javascript challenge

# Technology Stack used

React, Redux, Express, nodejs, mongoDB, webpack,


# Steps to run

1. clone this project
2. install nodeJS
3. do 'npm install' in project root folder
4. do  'npm start' - wait untill node server starts
5. access website in browser at URL: http://localhost:3000



# Important Note

The is a fully functional web-app with only one deviation from requirements i.e i did not use mongoDB for storing cart items. The reason is a combination of time constraint and an unexpected issue i faced about accessing jquery from webpack generated bundled JS modules, i needed the jquery for API calls.
